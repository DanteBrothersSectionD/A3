Html-
Nothing crazy for the HTML, i just organized everything into id's that I called upon in the css for styling and in the js file for the javascript code to make the quiz actually work. It's mostly composed of the
basic layout for my quiz like the "start here" button or the format for the different answers to choose from. The javascript is where I get to actually fill in the questions adn answers and then call upon them.
All the text you see for the final score and how many questions there are/your current score are all written in the html.

Css-
The css is always the easiest part imo because making visuals is both fun and alot easier on the coding aspect. I just went for a basic colour scheme that matches a bible cover and I also added and image of Jesus
giving a thumbs up to you (technically in the html code but whatever it's visual). I used containers for the quiz as I felt I didn't really need to use cards and containers get the job done just fine (for the sake
of a quiz atleast). 

Javascript-
This is the meat and potatoes of the code because everything that is referrenced in the html gets used in the javascript code to make everything work. Instead of explaining everything I'll just go over the main
features:

- A section to input your name before starting the quiz
- Working buttons to start the quiz, answer the questions, and replay the quiz once it's finished
- The button turning green or red depending on if you got the question right or wrong
- The code tracking each question and assigning points to you depending on if you got the question right or wrong
